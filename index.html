                        It started with 3 engineers, all super busy in their work, running from classes to assignments to submissions with no end at sight. Stuck in a rut, they were helpless with society dangling it's chains and restraining them from spreading their wings too far. Soon they realised that they were forced to do the same monotonous things in their 9-5 job which they never intended to do. Yet deep down they yearned for something more, something that would make them feel alive, something after which they could get behind with their whole and soul. Something which defied society's expectations of them and by which they could truly feel free from its grasp.
                        <br>
                        They started slowly and under the radar. They started a small apparel enterprise yet they kept it lowkey as they didn't want to attract attention from their friends and families who they feared might judge them for sacrificing the stability of a day to day job to pursue something as reckless and risky as starting a new business. These friends jokingly named the company as "Dedshana". As time passed they realised that life is too short to live by other's rules. So after a lot of planning, hardships, meetings, brainstorming sessions and numerous hours of roaming the streets of Mumbai, that fake venture turned into a real one. Yet, to honour their humble beginnings and intent they decided to stick with the old name, and thus Dedshana was born.

Para 2 - why are we called the fake company? 

It started with 3 engineers, all super busy in their work, running from classes to assignments to submissions with no end at sight. Stuck in a rut, they were helpless with society dangling it's chains and restraining them from spreading their wings too far. Soon they realised that they were forced to do the same monotonous things in their 9-5 job which they never intended to do. Yet deep down they yearned for something more, something that would make them feel alive, something after which they could get behind with their whole and soul. Something which defied society's expectations of them and by which they could truly feel free from its grasp.

They started slowly and under the radar. They started a small apparel enterprise yet they kept it lowkey as they didn't want to attract attention from their friends and families who they feared might judge them for sacrificing the stability of a day to day job to pursue something as reckless and risky as starting a new business. These friends jokingly named the company as "The Fake Company". As time passed they realised that life is too short to live by other's rules. So after a lot of planning, hardships, meetings, brainstorming sessions and numerous hours of roaming the streets of Mumbai, that fake venture turned into a real one. Yet, to honour their humble beginnings and intent they decided to stick with the old name, and thus The Fake company was born.
